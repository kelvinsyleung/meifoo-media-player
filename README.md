# Dynamic streaming video player for concert hall music videos
This video player is developed for playing multiple videos in sync within a same context, specifically different shots within a same concert.

Typical concert hall music videos are recorded with multiple video cameras and post-concert video editing often use the same soundtrack.
The videos are processed to support adaptive bitrate streaming and hosted through an external cloud provider.

## Multiple video synchronise play
The video player supports multiple video view and switching between playing videos. When multiple videos are viewed in sync, a lower bit rate is selected by default to prevent excess bandwidth used.

Synchronised playback mechanism of the multiple videos involves speeding up or slowing down out-synced videos within the same session.
